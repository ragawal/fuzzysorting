To fuzzy-sort n given inervals of the form [ai,bi], where ai<=bi. This fuzzy sorting algorithm will use the general structure of quick sort interval but will also take advantage of overlapping intervals to improve the running time.

The intervals are provided in the three text files. Total overlap should take the least time while small overlap will take the most.

The code also records the running time for different intervals.
